# 👋 Hi there! I'm Alfonso Murrieta Villegas.

I'm not just a **Data Scientist**; I'm a **Data Strategist** specializing in **unlocking new levels of organizational performance** 📈.

My expertise—forged from a rigorous background in **economic modeling and statistics**—is now channeled into deploying **high-ROI Machine Learning solutions** that turn raw data into **predictive assets** and **clear competitive advantages**.

## 🧠 My Philosophy

To me, data isn't just numbers; it's a **strategic asset**. I focus on the entire data science lifecycle, ensuring every project:

1.  **Exploration:** Solves the correct business question. 🎯
2.  **Modeling:** Uses effective and transparent algorithms. ✨
3.  **Action:** Clearly communicates insights to stakeholders. 🗣️

## 🚀 Projects and Interests

Here you'll find a mix of personal and professional projects, primarily developed using **Python** (Pyspark, Scikit-learn, PyTorch) and **Cloud technologies** (Azure, GCP, AWS). ☁️

I'm always open to collaborating on:

* Advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** tasks. 💬
* Building end-to-end **API-backed prediction services**. 🛠️
* Any opportunity to work with large, complex datasets. 📊

Feel free to connect and explore my work!
